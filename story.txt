There was once a little girl who dreamt of becoming a tennis player. Her dreams and aspirations were her drive and she was one determind girl who wanted to make sure she could achieve anything.
Her name was Sara, a girl living in New York facinated with her a Wilson tennis racket and addidas shoes.
Her days consisted of going to school, learning the basics, and playing tennis. She was a desperate person willing to develop her technique and skills in tennis.
Few years past and she eventually started to love the sport and wanted to play in professional level.
Although, she was advised to finish her Junior year schooling, compete for her school in varsity events and then elevate herself in playing junior level professional tennis.
This is what she followed through with and is now ranked as on of the top 50 players of the world.....there is more to her story, but looks like her biography will spill it all.
Nowadays, many young female tennis-fanatics look up to Sara as a beacon of inspiration, just as she did to her own tennis idols.
I dont know what is going on but this is a long long story

Sara will go down in history as being the first female tennis player to win all 4 grandslam titles. 
Then sara retired from her sport career and started up a business. She now trained little kids tennis. But secretly she is now working with the Kings Men. Her new job is merely a cover for her to gather information from rich family who can support their children to persue tennis.
And one day sara's cover was exposed and she got arrested by DPKR government.She lost her eyes under the brutal interagation.Then she got rescued by deadpool. Nowadays, she just worked as a blind lady who offer deadpool shelter, weapon, and life advice.
