There was once a little girl who dreamt of becoming a tennis player. Her dreams and aspirations were her drive and she was one determind girl who wanted to make sure she could achieve anything.
Her name was Sara, a girl living in New York facinated with her a Wilson tennis racket and addidas shoes.
Her days consisted of going to school, learning the basics, and playing tennis. She was a desperate person willing to develop her technique and skills in tennis.
Few years past and she eventually started to love the sport and wanted to play in professional level.
Although, she was advised to finish her Junior year schooling, compete for her school in varsity events and then elevate herself in playing junior level professional tennis.
This is what she followed through with and is now ranked as on of the top 50 players of the world.....there is more to her story, but looks like her biography will spill it all.
Nowadays, many young female tennis-fanatics look up to Sara as a beacon of inspiration, just as she did to her own tennis idols.
I dont know what is going on but this is a long long story

Sara will go down in history as being the first female tennis player to win all 4 grandslam titles.
